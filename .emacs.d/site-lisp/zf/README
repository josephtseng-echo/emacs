zf-mode README
===============================================================================
DISCLAIMERS

Although at this time I provide some packages and elisp files needed for 
zf-mode, please note that I did not write, nor do I maintain, all of them.
This means that for packages I do not maintain, if you use the ones I provide, 
they may not be the latest version, but should work with zf-mode.

The currently bundled packages that I do not maintain are:
 - camelCase.el
 - php-electric.el

===============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS

zf-mode comes with pretty much everything neccesary to run it.  Emacs version 
23 or later is recommended.  There are some optional packages which have 
support within zf-mode, but which are not bundled with zf-mode itself, 
including
 - company-mode
 - wrap-region
 - hideshowvis (hideshow is included with emacs 23 typically)

Note that there is a known issue with company-mode version 0.5, or at least
with the version available from elpa.  See the INSTALL section for details.

Your system needs to have at least PHP installed on it (of course), and to use
any of the testing programs (phpunit, phpcs, phpmd), you need to have those
installed as well.

===============================================================================
INSTALL

Ensure that all required modes and elisp files are on the load path and loaded.
Also ensure that zf-mode's elisp files are on the load path and loaded.
Put this in your .emacs file:

(require 'zf-mode)
(zf-mode-setup)

Either execute these two lines of code, or restart emacs.

At this point, you should be ready to use zf-mode.  Just open up a php or phtml 
file, and you should find yourself in zf-mode.  You should have a ZF menu and 
"zf" should be in the mode line.

To get an idea of what you can do with zf-mode, you can get a description and 
list of keybindings/functions for zf-mode by typing:
    C-h m
when inside of a zf-mode file.

If you have existing projects, or would like to add a new one, you can add them
to the php-project list by running:
    M-x php-project-add

If you are starting a new project, you can use create the directories and add 
the new project to your php-project-list all at once by running:
    M-x zf-create-directory-structure

Notes:

There is a known issue with company-mode version 0.5.  If company mode isn't 
loading, or you get errors about pysmell or gtags, you need to remove the
gtags and pysmell backends from company-mode.  Cutomize the variable
`company-backends` and remove the lines for `company-pysmell` and 
`company-gtags`.

While you're at it, you can also add a User-Defined company backend to the
merged backends section of company-backends called `company-my-php-backend`.
This backend will check the php.net documentation for completions of php
keywords and such.

Also included is a custom ruleset for phpcs, called ZFMode. You are welcome to
use this, if you wish. In order to do so, either copy or symlink the ZFMode
directly in the main directory to where ever your phpcs rulesets are.

===============================================================================
CONFIGURATION

You can use the various "customize ..." options in the zf-mode menus to 
customize zf-mode.  Hopefully most of these customize options are 
self-explanatory.  For a full list of cutomize options, just browse through
each of the customize groups with `M-x customize-group`:
 - php-completion
 - php-doc
 - php-format
 - php-parse
 - php-project
 - php-tags
 - php-test
 - zf-mode
 - zf-mode-extras

***********
EXECUTABLES

You may need to tell emacs where various executables are.  For instance, if 
php, phpunit, or phpcs (if you use the latter two) are not on your operating 
system's execute path, you may need to customize the following variables to 
tell them explicitly where the executables are:

php-exectuable
phpcs-shell-command
phpmd-shell-command
phpunit-shell-command

************************
PROJECTS AND DIRECTORIES

To add a project to the projects list the easy way, run:
    M-x php-project-add
Alternatively, you can add projects manually by going to 
    ZF -> Project -> Customize Projects 
in the menu or by typing
    M-x customize-variable php-project-list

If you use customize, the main variable to setup here is the PHP Project List.
This is a list of directories on your computer that correspons with a set of
php files or project.

To setup a project, insert a new item in the list and fill in the fields:

Project Nickname - This is just a nickname for the project.
Project Directory - This is the base directory for the project.  For projects
    using the Zend Framework, this will typically be the directory where 
    application, library, etc, are.
Project TAGS File - This is the TAGS file for the project.
Extra TAGS Directories - A list of directories to include when generating the 
    project TAGS file.  You may want to put the Zend Framework directories here.
    Project directory is included by default.
PHPUnit Config File - This is the xml configuration file that phpunit will use
    when phpunit is run from zf-mode.
phpcs/phpmd Subdirectories - This is a list of directories which should be
    included when phpcs is run for the project directory.  
phpdoc overrides - these are project specific phpdoc information to include in
    doc blocks.  Project agnostic defaults can be set by customizing php-doc.
Zend Framework Global Namespace - This is the namespace of files generated 
    outside of modules (in the "main area" so to speak).  Traditionally, this 
    was "Default" but has recently more likely to be "Application".  This will 
    result in, for instance, models outside of modules being named 
    Default_Model_<name> or Application_Model_<name>.  (Only necessary for 
    projects using Zend Framework).
Zend Framework Default Module - This is the default module that will be used as
    default if the Zend project makes use of a default module in the modules
    directory instead of keeping default controllers, models, etc, inside the
    applications directory (not in modules).  (Only necessary for projects 
    using Zend Framework).

****
TAGS

Tags files are basically compiled files of symbols that link various files
together, allowing you, for instance, to find the definition of a function by
"following" its name in a call somewhere else in your code.  This is done in 
emacs using the find-tag function, bound to M-. by default.

In order to use tags, you have to do two things:

1.) Create a tags file
2.) Load the tags file

The php-tags portion of zf-mode eases this process.  It requires you to have 
exhuberant-ctags installed.  This is different from ctags.  Basically, in my
experience, if your ctags does not have a -e flag, you need to get 
exhuberant-ctags to use.  There is a customizable variable 
php-tag-shell-command where you can set the path to your ctags command if 
neccessary.

To create a tags file you can either go to
    ZF -> Tags -> Create tags file
in the menu, or run
    M-x php-create-tag-file

A tags file will be created in the location given in the php-project-list 
settings for the current project.  After the tags file is generated, you will 
be prompted to load the newly created tags file.

Once the tags files is created, php-project will automatically load it whenever
you switch to a file or buffer that resides inside that project's directory.
